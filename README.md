🎯 Why This Journey?
This challenge is a structured approach to achieve clear, professional goals:

Develop Strong Habits: Building the discipline to code daily, prioritizing consistency over perfection.

Learn in Public: Staying accountable, receiving feedback, and connecting with the developer community.

Grow as a Full Stack Developer: Deepening my knowledge across the entire stack (Frontend, Backend, Database).

Explore Cybersecurity: Integrating secure coding practices and vulnerability awareness from day one.

💡 “The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried.”

📈 Reflections & Milestones
This is where I share the human side of the journey—the challenges, breakthroughs, and key takeaways. It adds a powerful storytelling element to the log.

The Challenge of Day 15: CORS Errors
"I spent hours debugging a CORS error when trying to fetch data from my local API. It felt like hitting a wall, but after deeply reviewing HTTP headers and Express middleware, I realized my server setup was missing a crucial configuration. Solving it didn't just fix a bug; it deepened my fundamental understanding of how web security and browser interactions work. Consistency > Perfection."

Future Goals (Post-100 Days)
Transition my MERN stack projects to use Next.js for SSR and better performance.

Pass the Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP) certification.

Contribute to two open-source projects.
